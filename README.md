# ✈️ Exploratory Data Analysis on Flights Dataset

In this project, I performed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the **Flights Sample Dataset** available in the **Seaborn library**.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

* **Pandas** – Data Cleaning & Analysis
* **Seaborn** – Statistical Data Visualization
* **Matplotlib** – Plotting & Custom Visuals

---

## 📊 Analysis Performed

* **Loading the dataset** from Seaborn
* **Distribution of passengers month-wise**
* **Distribution of passengers year-wise**
* **Year-on-Year (YoY) Growth** calculation (% change from previous year)
* **Histogram of passengers** to study the overall distribution
* **Distribution across month & year** (seasonality analysis)

---

## 🔑 Key Insights

* **July & August** consistently record the **highest number of passengers**.
* The **number of passengers increased every year** during the dataset timeline.
* **Highest YoY growth** was from **1950 → 1951** with **+21.84%**.
* **Lowest YoY growth** was from **1957 → 1958** with **+3.42%**.
* The **distribution of passengers is right-skewed** → More flights carried fewer passengers.
* **July & August of 1960** recorded the **maximum passengers overall**.


👉 Would you like me to also prepare a **GitHub-friendly README with proper code snippets** (loading data, plots, calculations) so that recruiters/collaborators can directly see the workflow?
